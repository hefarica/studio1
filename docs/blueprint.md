- Accent color: Sky blue (#38B2AC) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look, for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear and consistent icons representing server status and functions, based on the existing user interface design. Focus on simple, geometric forms for scalability.

- Subtle animations for scanning progress and status updates. Loading animations should be smooth and unobtrusive, reflecting scanning increments.
